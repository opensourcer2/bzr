Description: GTK+ User Interface Build core library
 Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick and easy development of user
 interfaces for the GTK+ 2 toolkit.
 .
 Glade is, since its "3.0" major version, highly modular, and composed
 of widgets which can be used by other applications to integrate
 functionality similar to the one provided by the Glade application
 itself.
 .
 This library provides all the widgets and core code, like parsing and
 saving files.

Description: GTK+ 2 User Interface Builder
 Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick and easy development of user
 interfaces for the GTK+ 2 toolkit.
 .
 The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in the well-known
 XML format, enabling easy integration with external tools. You will
 probably want to use it with tools such as libglade, which can load
 the XML files and create the interfaces at runtime.
 .
 This version is more modular than previous ones, so you can install
 modules to add additional widgets for Glade to use. You can install
 the glade-gnome package to provide GNOME widgets, for instance.
